# 🧩 HoiTruyenChu Patches

Morphe patches for **iTruyenChu** (`com.ngoctieucac.itruyenchu`), tested on version 2.1.0.

They fix text-to-speech reading (stops with the screen off, after a phone call, play button doing nothing,
speed change ignored until pause + play), fix Google login, show the real chapter titles instead of "Vô Đề Mục",
and make the reading history sync with your account automatically.

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Auto sync reading history](#auto-sync-reading-history) | Syncs the reading history with the iTruyenChu account without pressing the sync button: free chapters 1-50, which the server never sees, are recorded too, and the progress from other devices is merged in (with book titles) when the app starts. |  |
| [Background reading](#background-reading) | Keeps reading with the screen off: React Native pauses JS timers when the app goes to the background, which stops the app from starting the next chapter. JS timers keep running while a reading session is active. |  |
| [Fix Google login](#fix-google-login) | Fixes "Đăng nhập với Google" failing with error 400: the server now expects the Firebase ID token (like the website) instead of the email sent by this app version. |  |
| [Show chapter titles](#show-chapter-titles) | Shows the real chapter titles instead of "Vô Đề Mục" in the chapter list, the reader and the TTS: books whose chapter list only has "Chương N" get the title from the first line of the chapter text (public preview, no login needed), cached on the device. |  |
| [TTS reliability](#tts-reliability) | Fixes text-to-speech reading that stops after a phone call or does nothing when pressing play: re-creates the TTS engine when it dies, pauses during calls and resumes afterwards, retries failed lines, uses the correct Vietnamese voice, and applies a new speed right away instead of after pause + play. |  |

## 🔍 Notes on the app

iTruyenChu is an Expo / React Native app; its logic is Hermes bytecode, so the patches hook the
native modules it uses (expo-speech, React Native timers, AsyncStorage) instead of app code.

- **Reading history**: a zustand store persisted in AsyncStorage (`RKStorage` database) under the key `read`,
  the login under `auth-storage`. The reader only updates the local store.
- **Why sync was unreliable**: the server records the progress itself whenever a chapter is downloaded with
  the login token (`GET /chapters/{slug}/content/{n}`). The app (and the website) only do that for chapter 51
  and later; chapters 1–50 come from a public URL (`/free/{slug}/chuong-{n}.txt`) and are never recorded.
  The recorded progress (`POST /users/sync-books-new` -> `{slug: chapter}`) was only pulled when pressing the
  sync button. (`POST /users/sync-books`, used by the history screen button, now answers HTTP 500.)
- **Google login**: the app signs in to Firebase, then sends `POST /auth/login-firebase {email}`.
  The server (and the website) now use `{idToken: firebaseUser.getIdToken()}`, so the app gets 400.
  The patch adds an interceptor to React Native's OkHttp client that keeps the Firebase ID token from
  `accounts:signInWithIdp` and sends it instead, then adds the profile to the answer if it has no `user`.
- **Auto sync patch**: when a free chapter is downloaded, downloads it once more with the token in the background
  so the server records it; on app start pulls the recorded progress and merges it into the stored history before
  the app loads it (waits at most 4.5 s, offline-safe). Entries that only have a slug and a chapter get their title
  and chapter count from the public `books/{slug}.json`, like the reader does.
- **"Vô Đề Mục"**: the chapter list (`/chapters/{slug}.json.gz` = `{"207": {"title": "Chương 207"}}`) has no real
  title for many books, so the app (and the website) strip "Chương 207" and show "Vô Đề Mục". The real title is the
  first `Chương N: ...` line of the chapter text, and the public preview (`/preview/{slug}/chuong-{n}-preview.txt`,
  gzip; `/free/...` for chapters 1–50) starts with it. The patch reads the first kilobyte of each (HTTP Range,
  no login, nothing recorded), caches the titles in `files/htc-chapter-titles/`, and fills them into the downloaded
  list and into the copy the app keeps in AsyncStorage (`s3:{url}`, refreshed hourly). Some chapters really have no title.
- **TTS speed**: the voice bar's reading chain (`speakLine` -> `onDone` -> `speakLine`) keeps the speed of the render
  in which play was pressed. The voice bar store is saved in AsyncStorage as `tts_voice_state`
  (`{"state":{"spead":..}}`, sic), so the patch takes the speed from there and speaks the current line again at it.
